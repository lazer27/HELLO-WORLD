# HELLO-WORLD

Name: Kevin Tyler LaZur

Purpose: I hope to apply this to my small discord channel and use the power behind a tool like github to help those around me, and to take leadership by creating objectives using these resources. These goals will hopefully be either entirely impossible without the assistance of this technology, or greatly expediated by it.

Bio: Student at the University of Kentucky, majoring in Computer Engineering. Part-Time Building and Systems Engineering Supervisor and Control Room Operator at UPS. I play guitar, and have picked up the habit of reading again. My favorite bands right now are Ty Segall, Thee Oh Sees, and Jay Reatard.
