# HELLO-WORLD

First Repository

Name: Kevin Tyler LaZur

Purpose: I hope to use github in tandem with the knowledge of database analysis I could stand to learn from my work at UPS. I hope to apply this to my small discord channel and use the power behind a tool like github to help those around me, and to take leadership by creating objectives using these resources. These goals will hopefully be either entirely impossible without the assistance of this technology, or greatly expediated by it.

Bio: Student at the University of Kentucky, majoring in Computer Science. Part-Time Supervisor at UPS. I play guitar, and have picked up the habit of reading again. I enjoy Super Smash Brothers, and I like the new one, Smash Ultimate. My favorite bands right now are Ty Segall, Thee Oh Sees, and Jay Reatard.
